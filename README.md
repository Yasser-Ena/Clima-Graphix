## Overview

The weather web app aims to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information in a user-friendly manner. With its real-time weather data, radar map feature, beach condition feature, the ocean condition feature for fishing in the ocean, and customizable display options, the app offers valuable insights into current and forecasted weather conditions.

By leveraging reliable weather data sources and utilizing modern web technologies, the app ensures that users have access to the most reliable and accurate weather information available. The real-time weather data includes details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. Users can stay informed about the current weather conditions for their location.

The radar map feature enhances the user experience by visually representing weather patterns and precipitation. Users can easily identify areas of rain, snow, or storms on the map, allowing them to plan their activities accordingly. The radar map can be updated in real-time or near real-time, providing users with a dynamic and interactive view of the weather in their area.

The Beach Condition feature is designed to enhance the user experience by providing valuable information about the beach conditions. Users can access real-time data regarding factors such as water temperature, wave height, wind conditions, and tide levels. This feature enables beach goers to make informed decisions and plan their beach activities accordingly. By incorporating this feature into the weather web app, users can have a comprehensive understanding of both the atmospheric and beach conditions, ensuring a safe and enjoyable beach experience.

The Ocean Condition feature is specifically designed to cater to fishers, providing them with valuable information to enhance their fishing experience and ensure their safety. Users can access real-time data on ocean conditions such as water temperature, wave height, wind speed and direction, and tide levels. This feature equips fishers with the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions about the best fishing spots and times. By incorporating the Ocean Condition feature into the weather web app, fishers can maximize their chances of a successful fishing trip while staying safe by being aware of potentially hazardous conditions.

The weather web app also offers customizable display options, allowing users to tailor the app's appearance to their preferences. They can choose between different units of measurement, such as Celsius or Fahrenheit, and select a light or dark theme for the interface. This customization ensures that users have a personalized experience while accessing weather information.

By incorporating reliable weather data sources and implementing modern web technologies, the weather web app delivers a seamless and informative experience. It empowers users to make informed decisions based on accurate weather forecasts and real-time weather conditions. Whether planning outdoor activities or staying updated on weather changes, the weather web app provides users with valuable insights to help them navigate their daily lives.

## My process 

### Built with / Project technical specification

- This project is builded using pure HTML CSS JS.
- Semantic HTML5 markup:
  > I did use nav element to contain's the navigation, section element to contain the main content and the footer element to conation the footer content.
- CSS custom properties and media queries:
  >I did use tow media queries to change the style of the HTML element depends of the screen width, the first one is in 52.125rem **Large tablets**, and the second one is in 75rem **Laptop & Desktop**.
- Interactive and functional using Vanilla JS:
  >I did JavaScript for two main purposes. Firstly, it was employed to create interactivity between the user and the page, enabling features such as menu toggling and other interactive elements. Secondly, JavaScript was instrumental in accomplishing tasks that couldn't be achieved solely with CSS or HTML. For instance, in the navigation section, JavaScript was employed to manipulate the layout by breaking a div into two items: the menu icon and the customize tab. This was necessary because both the nav element and body employed the same grid template columns, '12column,' in the desktop version of the web app. To align the menu icon with the sidebar, both elements had to be repositioned within the last two columns, and the customize tab required a margin right that matched the padding in the dashboard section. JavaScript provided the flexibility and control needed to achieve these layout adjustments seamlessly.
